# Back End Capstone: Pup Tracker
This is my back-end capstone project for Nashville Software School. The app allows the user to login and create pet profiles for each of their pets, and keep track of data like how much food he or she ate, when he or she went to the vet, and how much he or she weighs. In addition to that, you can create a pet profile and have a different user add it to her or her household to see/add events to the pet timeline. 

## Getting Started

First, you'll need to clone the project to your machine: 
```
$ git clone https://github.com/sarahmorris926/Pup-Tracker.git
```

Next, need to install the dependencies included in the `package.json` file. 
```
npm install
```

In addition, you'll have to install node and sass (which were installed globally on my machine): 
```
npm install node sass
```

Next, you'll find a `.env.example` file in the root of this project. Create a `.env` file and add the correct contents: 
```
PORT=<port number>
NODE_ENV="<development or testing etc>"
```
My project was done with `PORT 3000` so my examples will use `localhost:3000/` as the URL.
